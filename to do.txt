to do

- make the deployed track more than one deployment of the contract
- make the compiler compile and link multi class and library contracts




notes:

truffle probably uses a contract on the chain to track deployments because then it has a record of what's been deployed on that specific chain, if it stores the info locally then it might be deploying to a different chain



pragma solidity ^0.4.1;  contract Contract_1{      uint stored_value;      function Contract_1(){         stored_value = 100;     }      function get_stored_value() constant returns (uint){         return stored_value;     } }
