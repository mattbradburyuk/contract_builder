to do

- make the deployed track more than one deployment of the contract
- make the compiler compile and link multi class and library contracts




notes:

truffle probably uses a contract on the chain to track deployments because then it has a record of what's been deployed on that specific chain, if it stores the info locally then it might be deploying to a different chain


pragma solidity ^0.4.1;  contract child_contract is base_contract {      uint child_value;      function child_contract(){         child_value = 200;     }      function get_child_value() constant returns (uint){         return child_value;     } }\n
