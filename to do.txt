to do

- make the deployed track more than one deployment of the contract
- make the compiler compile and link multi class and library contracts

- add cl tool

- parameterise mushroom config + contract_config


- get multi deployment working

- add usage if cli errors

notes:

truffle probably uses a contract on the chain to track deployments because then it has a record of what's been deployed on that specific chain, if it stores the info locally then it might be deploying to a different chain
